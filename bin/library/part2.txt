Do you have any tips on making a resume?
I could give you some pointers. Do you want to focus on the resume or the jobs you're applying for?
2
The jobs.
Okay. You might've experienced this already, but there definitely aren't many jobs for teenagers like you. If anything, I suggest that you try to finish school and get a diploma. Are you planning to?
3
Yes.
Ok. I'm glad you're thinking about your future. It's best to keep your options open, even when you're facing such a rough time.
4
Thank you for the list.
I'll let you know how it goes.
5
No, I don't see the point.
Hmmm. For now, it might not affect you, but it will definitely limit your options in the future. I'm going to suggest against that, but again, it's about your current situation.
6
I suppose so.
Good luck.
7
I don't think I'm able to. Thank you, though.
No problem, good luck.

The resume.
Sure! If you follow me, I can get that done in under half an hour. Along with this resume though, I still strongly suggest thinking of finishing your degree. Would you be interested in that?
