TO BE IMPROVED:
- Escape room dialogue is currently unavailable, to be implemented later (current win condition is passing the minigame 7 times)
- Adding street location to escape room and improving graphics (currently only school and library locations exist)
- Panic room story is working but has to be changed to be geared towards our target audience (new story is complete but has not been implemented)
