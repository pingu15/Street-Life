Hi there! Good to see you again. I've decided to apply to one of the job applications here.
Oh really? How did you find out about us?
2
A really kind person told me about this opportunity on the street.
Ah, I'm glad. We are indeed hiring, follow me.
3
Great.
So, what do you think you can bring to the facility?
4
My lunch? 
I- that's not the answer we're looking for. Let's be serious here... Why do you want to work here?
5
I can bring a positive attitude, and I'll be sure to be present and treat my co-workers with respect.
Good answer, now why do you want to work here?
6
I think I can be a positive contributer and I could really use a job like this to get back on track with my life.
Alright, I like your answers.. you're hired. Let's go fill out some forms and you'll be good to go.

Okay, that's better... Let's see... what is one reason we shouldn't hire you?
8
I need a job, I'm homeless man.
Not quite the answer we're looking for.. but either way what is one reason we shouldn't hire you?
9
I'm very indecisive, but I'm willing to ask questions for help.
I like that, and I like you. I'm willing to give you a shot. Let's go fill out some paperwork and you're hired.

I have no experience.
Alright, I don't really think you have what we're looking for exactly, so I'm afraid I don't think we can get you a job... perhaps with some more experience we'll see you around next year.
