Do you know about any help that the city gives to the homeless?
I certainly do. Is this for a research project, or something else....?
2
A research project.
Ok. Well, I can help you sort through some sources on homelessness in Toronto. It's quite a difficult problem, especially on its scale and the people it affects.
3
Do you have resources on jobs available to the homeless population?
Definitely. Well, before one can get a job, it would be best if they could create a resume...

Thank you. Can you show me how one would get out of such a situation?
Definitely. One of the best things one could do for themself is create a resume.

I'm looking for some help. The thing is, my family kicked me out of the house, and I just need to place to do some work.
I'm very sorry to hear that. Myself and other librarians will be here to offer any help we can, so don't be afraid to ask.

Do you know of any job openings lately?
Not that I can think of, sorry. However, if one does pop up, I suggest you getting a resume.
7
Are there any places for me to create a resume?
Definitely. Right this way, I'll help you out. *You create a resume*

Oh... well... to come clean, I'm actually in need of help, I've been abandoned by my parents and I need a long term solution.
Oh... I'm so sorry. You should've said so. Is there anything I can do to help?
