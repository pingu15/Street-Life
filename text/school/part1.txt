Hi.
Hey. What's up?
2
Do you want to go to the library after school? We could do some homework together.
Hmmmm... sure, why not? I'll get my library card. Do you have yours?
3
Oh, I don't have one. That might be a problem.
Hm, check your computer maybe??? You can probably find your library card in those folders somewhere.
4
Oh, thank you so much! I'll see you there then.
No problem.
5
Do you think I can borrow yours?
I don't think that's allowed... and I don't know why you want to use a library computer instead of your laptop...
6
The thing is, my family kicked me out of the house, and I just need to place to do some work.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... if you need any help, feel free to reach out then.
7
You know what, never mind.
Okay, then.
8
Would it be okay if I borrow some money?
Uh, what do you need it for?
9
I don't have the money for dinner. Just 10 bucks would do.
Oh yea, sure. Make sure to return it tomorrow, though.
10
Wait, I don't know if I can get it to you then. It's alright, I won't take your money.
Oh, okay then.
11
Oh, definitely. Thank you.
No problem.
12
...stuff?
Uh, that isn't the greatest reason. I'm sorry, but I don't think I can.
13
Alright then, sorry.
Uh huh...

Okay, the thing is, my family kicked me out of the house, and I just need to place to do some work and have something to eat.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... here, you can take this money then. Oh, and also, check your computer for a library card maybe.
