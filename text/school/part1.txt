Hi.
Hey. What's up?
2
Do you want to go to the library after school? We could do some homework together.
Hmmmm... sure, why not? I'll get my library card. Do you have yours?
3
Oh, I don't have one. That might be a problem.
Hm, check your computer maybe??? You can probably find your library card in those folders somewhere.
4
Oh, thank you so much! I'll see you there then.
No problem.
5
Uh, no... do you think I can borrow yours?
I don't think that's allowed... and I don't know why you want to use a library computer instead of your laptop...
6
The thing is, my family kicked me out of the house, and I just need to place to do some work.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... if you need any help, feel free to reach out then.
7
You know what, screw this. What am I gonna do at the library anyways?
I mean, there's a lot that could help you get out of homelessness, but okay then.
8
Oh.. Hm. Alright, I'll come.
Great. Oh, and check your computer for a library card... I'm sure you got one in those files somewhere.
9
Nah, whatever.
Alright, whatever suits you.

Thanks, but do you know where I can get a library card?
Not sure, but check your computer perhaps. I'm sure you got a copy of it somewhere there.
