Hi.
How are you doing?
2
I'm still finding my way around this new situation.
It's gotta be tough for you. Where do you usually go each night to sleep?
3
I sometimes find a homeless shelter around 30 minutes from here.
I'm happy that you at least have a place to stay.
4
Yea, thank you.
Good luck.
5
I wouldn't call myself lucky, if that's what you're saying.
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. My bad.
6
It's always a gamble. Shelters sometimes don't have enough beds.
Shoot. Hey, if you need to, I can always convince my parents to get you to stay a night.
7
Wait, that would be incredible! Thank you so much.
No problem!
8
I haven't talked to my parents in a while, so not great.
I could get my parents to talk to them.
9
I guess they could, if it isn't any trouble.
Alright, sounds good. Also, did you go to your parents' house at any point? I think it's worth a shot. At least better than your situation now.
10
I guess so. Thanks for the advice.
No problem, good luck.
11
No, I don't think I'd have a chance at all. I've only gone back once and they didn't answer the door.
Aw, I'm sorry. Not sure what else I can do to help, but let me know if anything comes up.
12
No, it's okay. I don't really want to make your parents to deal with mine.
Oh, alright. Just remember, that you can come to my house at any point.

Wow, thank you so much!
No problem!
