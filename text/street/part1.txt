Can anyone spare some change?
Hey, why are you out here on your own?
2
I don't have anywhere else to be.
Hmmm.  Where's your family?
3
They aren't particularly fond of me.
Have you run away from home?
4
Yes, but-
Alright. I'll get the police to pick you up and find your parents.
5
No.
Okay... Well, you're in front of my store, so you better find another place to stay the night.
6
Wait no-I really need a place to stay tonight.

Your store? Could I get a job here maybe?
I can't get you a full job, there aren't any openings. If you stick around though, I'll see how you do in the store for the week.
