Hi boss.
How is sweeping the store treating you?
2
It's going well.
That's nice. My cashier has left for paternity leave... so I'll need to find a new employer.
3
Really? I would definetly be interested in that role.
Hmm... I'll tell you what, if you can give me a resume, I'll think about it.
4
Thank you so much... do you know who I can get to help me make one?
Hmm... maybe go to the library? They may know.
5
It could be better.
I see. I'll tell you what, if you want any sort of promotion, I'd be glad to recieve a resume from you.
6
Sure. I'll try to get one to you at some point, maybe for a cashier.
Great! I'll see you when you put together a formal application, then.
7
Actually, I don't know if I'm up for the job.
This is fair. It's all up to you, but other people will be wanting that job too.
8
What's the pay like?
It's usually a minimum wage job. I'll see if you're qualified when we get there.

Ah, thank you!
I'll see ya around. Get me the resume soon, or I'll have someone else lined up.
