Hi boss.
How is sweeping the store treating you
2
It's going well.
That's nice. I'll still be looking if I need another employee.
3
Thank you.
No problem. That might not happen in a while, though, so I'm not making any promises.
4
I've also been taking naps in the back office, do you think I could spend the night there a few times a week?
As long as you work on the day of, and I get to check up on the room, you'll be fine. Will you be working here in the next few days?
5
Yes.
Great!
6
I'll be leaving this part of the city for now.
Oh, okay. I'll hear from you later, then. You know where I am.
7
It could be better.
I see. I don't know what else you can do, but if you want, I'd be glad to recieve a resume.
8
Sure. I'll try to get one to you at some point, maybe for a cashier.
Great! I'll see you when you put together a formal application, then.
9
Actually, I don't know if I'm up for the job.
This is fair. It's all up to you, but other people will be wanting that job too.

What's the pay like?
It's usually a minimum wage job. I'll see if you're qualified when we get there.
