Hi, how are you?
Hi there. I have something to tell you.
2
What is it?
One of my employees are leaving, and there's a new job opening.
3
Can I apply for the position?
That's what I came to talk about. I've gotten a few good applicants that also want a longer term job, and you haven't even submitted a resume yet.
4
I can get the resume done.
If so, I'll take a look. Since I don't think you have much to work with, I suggest going to the library. Come back when you have it done.
5
Oh, I have my resume already. Here.
Your resume looks good. You've had a bit of experience helping out already, so I'd be happy to hire you after a short interview. How does that sound?

On second thought, I don't know if I want to go into this full-time. I have school as well.
It's your decision. I'm leaving it open to anybody else, so maybe I'll see you again soon.

Great! Thank you so much.
Welcome to the business.
