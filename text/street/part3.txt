Hi, how are you?
Hi there. Do you got the resume?
2
Yep, here it is.
Hm... looks good. How comfortable are you with customer service?

I don't have the most experience, but I'm sure I can do just fine. I'm a quick learner.
Alright then. I believe you.

On second thought, I don't know if I want to go customer service full-time... I have school as well.
It's your decision. I do have another candidate, so I'll give them this oppertunity.
